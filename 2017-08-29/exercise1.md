Create an Array named superHeroes

Inside the superHeroes array create the following arrays: 
["Batman", "Bruce Wayne"],
["Spiderman", "Peter Parker"],
["The Flash", "Barry Allen"]

Map over the superHeroes to get an array like: ["Batman is Bruce Wayne", "Spiderman is Peter Parker", "The Flash is Barry Allen"];
*Hint1: create a function that does this for one superhero name and then use map on the array to get all of the requested arrays*

Join the entries in the resulting array and log them to the console.

Should log "Batman is Bruce Wayne, Spiderman is Peter Parker, The Flash is Barry Allen"
